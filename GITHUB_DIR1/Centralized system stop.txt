Limitations of Centralized System –

Can’t scale up vertically after a certain limit – After a limit, even if you increase the hardware and software capabilities of the server node, the performance will not increase appreciably leading to a cost/benefit ratio < 1.
Bottlenecks can appear when the traffic spikes – as the server can only have a finite number of open ports to which can listen to connections from client nodes. So, when high traffic occurs like a shopping sale, the server can essentially suffer a Denial-of-Service attack or Distributed Denial-of-Service attack.
